    <div class="child yellow">Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.</div>
    <div class="child transparent">Suddenly, there's not half the file there used to be, And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.</div>
    <div class="child orange">Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.</div>
    <div class="child tomato">Yesterday, The need for backups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.</div>
